## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Perform simple math operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and percentage

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Technologies used

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This project took me a little longer to develop because it requires better logic to make the calculator work correctly, but every day I solved a different bug and that helped me solve problems that I didn't even think I could solve.

## Acknowledgments
I would first like to thank God and the professor of the course logic programming with JavaScript Daniel Tapias Morales, who teaches about logic programming and how to best solve challenges using pure JavaScript.
